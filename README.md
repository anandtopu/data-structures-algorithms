# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms. It is intended for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills.

## Features

- Implementations of classic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Solutions to popular algorithmic problems (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Well-documented code with clear explanations
- Unit tests for verifying correctness
